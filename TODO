Trap ctrl+c, and display a message. Currently these signals are just ignored.
Priority: medium; difficulty: non-trivial without a standard C library. 
Signal-handling is horribly architecture-dependent

Handle over-long lines. This might require significant revision, and make
  the whole program more complex
Priority: high; difficulty: probably impossible without turning Bute into a 
real text editor

Implement a simple text search
Priority: high; difficulty: unknown. Probably not difficult, but time-consuming

Implement word-forward and word-back
Priority: medium; difficulty: moderate, given the design constraints of
low size and complexity. More difficult if the function has to wrap
over line boundaries

Provide an option to swap backspace and del. More control over key bindings
in general would be nice.
Priority: low, unless it proves to be a problem; difficulty: moderate

Hide cursor while refreshing screen
Priorty: low, unless it proves to be a problem; difficulty: trivial

Warn before writing a file that has changed since it was read
Priority: low, given the intended application; difficulty: easy but tedious

Provide a way to build using glibc, in situations where portability is
more important that size or binary compatibility
Priority: low; difficulty: easy
